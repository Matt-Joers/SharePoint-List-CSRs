  <h2>CSR Script Use Instructions</h2>
  <p>There are a few ways to implement the CSR scripts, you can either reference the file from a CEWP or place it in a Script Web Part OR you can reference the file from the Document/List Web Part Properties by placing the link to the script in the jslink field. If this is a reusable solution, you can add this to the site assets folder of the Site Collection or simply place it in the current "Site Asset" folder.</p>
  <h3>Notes about Scripts</h3>
  <p>Many of these scripts are publically available through other resources, but some of them have been modified to include conditional formatting such as the "Percentage" javascript file. Based on the range of the percentage, a different color will display in the % bar. </p>
  
  <p>Enjoy!</p>
